# Movies website

Folder structure:
- movies-api: nodeJs
- movies-web: React

## movies-api
You can run the project in development mode with `yarn run dev`.

## movies-web 
You can run the project in development mode with `yarn start`

You can access the frontend on localhost:3000 and the backend on localhost:8080
(for the movie query function you need a API key for the https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-movies API, for me it is stored in a .env file)
